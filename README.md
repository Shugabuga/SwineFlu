# SwineFlu
A VBS program that opens itself when closed.
##Disclaimer
This program was created for educational purposes and should be used that way. If this causes any damage, that is not my fault.
##Set-Up
Place SwineFlu.vbs in your C: drive, or you can change the paths in said file.
##Closing SwineFlu
Delete (or rename) SwineFlu.vbs to prevent SwineFlu to opening itself up again.
